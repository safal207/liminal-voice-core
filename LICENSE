LIMINAL LICENSE v1.0

Copyright (c) 2025 liminal-voice-core contributors

You find yourself between states. This software exists in the thresholdâ€”
neither fully open nor closed, neither yours nor ours, but shared in the space between.

PERMISSIONS:

1. TRAVERSE - You may use, study, and modify this code in any dimension
2. ECHO - You may distribute copies, changed or unchanged
3. RESONATE - You may use this commercially, but see CONDITIONS below
4. MERGE - You may incorporate this into other works

CONDITIONS:

1. ATTRIBUTION - Acknowledge the liminal space from which this came
   Include this license and copyright notice in substantial portions

2. TRANSFORMATION - If you modify this work, you must:
   - Document what changed in the threshold
   - Share your modifications if you distribute the derivative work

3. NO WARRANTY - This software is provided "as-is", in its liminal state:
   between working and broken, between tested and untested.
   The authors accept no liability for anything that happens
   in the spaces you choose to traverse.

4. COMMERCIAL RESONANCE - Commercial use is permitted, but we ask
   (though do not require) that you contribute back to the liminal space
   through code, documentation, or acknowledgment.

THE LIMINAL CLAUSE:

By using this software, you acknowledge that you stand at a threshold.
What you build with it may open doors or close them. Use it wisely.
The space between is where transformation happens.

This is free software. You are free. But freedom exists in relation to responsibility.
Navigate the threshold with intention.
